## You're another year closer to the best version of you. Keep at it! 🙂

### To the bestie

- who always turns my frowns upside down
- who knows me better than any other friend.
- I address "tu" and yet respect.
- I call "dii", "nee" and "baka".
- who is the best moral support any day.
- who is my favorite tubelight.
- who I fangirl about anime girls to.
- whose schooling I don't mind.
- whose future pets I spend time naming.
- I tolerate despite thinking DC < Marvel, and iPhones < Android. (Weirdo XD)
- who taught me bits and pieces of psychology.
- whose love for Simon Sinek is intolerable, but what other choice do I have.
- who was my first instagram follower.
- who made me feel like someone's little brother.
- who is one of my favorite parts of my life.
- I sibling adore. 

# Happy Birthday Baka!

Thanks for the memories.

The ones in the past, and the ones that'll come in the future.
